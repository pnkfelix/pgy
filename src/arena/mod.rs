    // Maybe the another orthogonal (and in some ways better) answer here would be to extend our type expression syntax to allow me to actually write the type `fn even` (which currently prints as `fn(&&i32) -> bool {even}` in a explicit type instantiation like `Map<Filter<Iter<'a, i32>, fn even>, fn add1>`

    // My original idea for `ArenaVex` was that creating the iterator
    // over it would be cheap (O(1)) since the elements never
    // move. However, the piece that I missed (which may be an
    // artifact of SimonSapin's simplified version of TypedArena) is
    // that while the elements within the inner vecs never move,
    // i.e. the backing storage for the inner vecs are never
    // reallocated, the *outer* vec is certainly reallocated as the
    // arena is pushed.
    //
    // There are various ways to deal with this. For example, I could
    // switch to a linked-list representation for the outer vec.
    // (That is in fact probably the best thing to do in the long
    // term.)
    //
    // However, now I want to put in the least effort possible, so
    // continue with vec-of-vec and just clone outer vec on each iter
    // (which means each iter creation costs something like O(lg n) --
    // which in reality is probably entirely acceptable), considering
    // it is also the worst-case cost of push in this scheme.
